If you want to just print the frames in which the objects went missing or are new, then use the second script i.e., detect_missing_new_objects.py file. Otherwise, use the first file. This file will save the predictions of the model in a video format along with the FPS counter on the top left corner of the video. The arguments for both the scripts are same except for one or two options, for which you could refer the code of the first python file i.e., detect_and_save_output_video.py file.
